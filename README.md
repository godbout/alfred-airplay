# WHAT IS THAT

Rather than clicking in the menu and choosing your display and blah blah blah, just open [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), type "ap", choose your display and KABOOM!!! Your display is extended to your AirPlay device.

# SETUP

*Unfortunately you need to make some changes yourself in the workflow (it's easy) because I can't find how to get the list of AirPlay devices through AppleScript (if you know please let me know or do a PR!).*

1. Download the workflow in the [release page](https://github.com/godbout/alfred-airplay/releases)
2. In Alfred, choose the workflow, double click the List Filter (first icon on the left) and add your devices and/or remove the ones you don't care about. What matters is that the "args" of the items list match the names of your devices. See [screenshot](https://github.com/godbout/alfred-airplay/blob/master/resources/screenshots/args.png).
3. Type "ap" in Alfred to see your list of set AirPlay displays. Choose one to extend the display as second screen.

Enjoy!
