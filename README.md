# WHAT IS THAT

Rather than clicking the menu bar and and choosing your display and blah blah blah, just open [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), type *aps*, choose your display and KABOOM!!! Your display is extended to your AirPlay device.

P.S. You can now access your [Sidecar](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210380) devices easily with the new *Go to AirPlay Menu* option. üòéÔ∏è

# MANDATORY SCREENSHOT

# SETUP

SETUP NO MORE! AirPlay Spreader now detects your AirPlay video servers automatically. (Only if connected to the same Wi-Fi network though.)

# ISSUE WITH BARTENDER

If you're using Bartender, hide the *AirPlay Displays* item and extend your display, you will not be able to Turn it Off from the Workflow. The current workaround is to *Show* or *Always Show* the *AirPlay Displays* item in Bartender. If you're mirroring your display then you don't need to do anything, it just works.

# DOWNLOAD

Latest release available on the [release page](https://github.com/godbout/alfred-airplay/releases).
